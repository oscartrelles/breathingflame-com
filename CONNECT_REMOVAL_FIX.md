# ðŸ”§ CONNECT Column Removal Fix

## âœ… **CONNECT Column Completely Removed**

Added explicit filtering to ensure the CONNECT column is completely removed from the footer, even if it exists in the CMS data.

## ðŸ”§ **Fix Applied**

### **Added Explicit Filter**
```tsx
{navigation?.footerGroups
  ?.filter((group) => group.title !== 'CONNECT') // Explicitly exclude CONNECT
  ?.sort((a, b) => (a.order || 0) - (b.order || 0))
  ?.map((group) => (
    // Render footer groups
  ))}
```

### **Why This Fix Was Needed**
- **Mock Data**: CONNECT group was removed from mock data
- **CMS Data**: If CONNECT group exists in FireCMS, it would still render
- **Caching**: Browser or component state might cache the old data
- **Explicit Filter**: Ensures CONNECT is never rendered regardless of data source

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**

The footer now:
- âœ… **Only Shows 4 Columns**: RESILIENCE, CLARITY, TRANSFORMATION, RESOURCES
- âœ… **No CONNECT Section**: Completely filtered out
- âœ… **All Social Links**: Under the logo as intended
- âœ… **Clean Layout**: 4-column grid with proper spacing

## ðŸ”„ **Technical Details**

### **Filter Logic**
```typescript
.filter((group) => group.title !== 'CONNECT')
```

This filter:
- **Runs First**: Before sorting and mapping
- **Explicit Check**: Exact string match for 'CONNECT'
- **Safe**: Won't affect other groups
- **Future-Proof**: Prevents CONNECT from appearing even if added back to CMS

### **Data Flow**
1. **CMS Data**: `navigation.footerGroups` from FireCMS
2. **Filter**: Remove any group with title 'CONNECT'
3. **Sort**: Order remaining groups by `order` property
4. **Render**: Map filtered groups to footer columns

## ðŸš€ **Verification**

To verify the fix:
1. **Check Footer**: Should only show 4 columns
2. **No CONNECT**: CONNECT section should be completely absent
3. **Social Links**: All 6 social icons under logo
4. **Responsive**: 4-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile

**Test at http://localhost:3000 - the CONNECT column should now be completely removed! ðŸŽ‰**
