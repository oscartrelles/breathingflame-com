The use of headphones created a deeply intimate and immersive environment even though we were within a group setting. The combination of guided breathwork, carefully curated music tracks, and a grounding meditation at the end made the session incredibly introspective and powerful. It allowed me to reconnect with myself and tap into something much greater. I‚Äôm truly grateful for the opportunity to participate, and I hope more people find their way to this work, especially parents in need of a reset, professionals managing high levels of stress, or anyone simply looking to reconnect and realign. Highly recommended. Thank you for holding such a transformative space.",

Clients came to trust Oscar as a tech lead who helped them any number of issues that global marketers normally face -- such as hosting, site speed, version control -- just to name a few. He's patient with those who don't speak technology at his level -- both internally and client-side. A great technologist - I strongly recommend Oscar."

It was way before that we first met in person that i heard about him as one of the most talented Latin Flash developers, kind of unreachable because he wasn't around Flash-related forums and was already living in the US. Though, from time to time he travelled to less-developed countries to share his knowledge with local developer communities, and that's how we first shared some emails. I found out that he is a genuine caring and thankful human being, worried about learning as much as he is about sharing what he learns, in order to get better (for himself and for the people surrounding him). So it's not only that he's doing some stunning work at one of the top digital shops in the world, but also the feeling that spending some time working with him will make you (much) better at work, and a better and (probably) more humble person.",

He combines the razor-sharp focus of the best programmers with the broader insight that effective managers possess. I know that my skills as a programmer improved simply by working with him and seeing him solve problems. He is good at identifying and encouraging the intellectual interests of his team, and has a natural feel for finding the best person for the job. As a leader, he's always been willing to fight the tough battles for his team. I offer him my highest recommendation.",

What truly amazed me was how impactful a 20-minute breathwork exercise could be. With Oscar‚Äôs supportive guidance, I was able to achieve a profound sense of relaxation and calm. The physical and mental shift I experienced before and after the session was both significant and noticeable. Since attending the workshop, I‚Äôve become much more mindful of my breathing in everyday moments. I‚Äôve also found that practicing deep breathing at night has been especially helpful in winding down before bed. It was also lovely meeting new people as the group was small and intimate. Thank you Oscar for a wonderful and uplifting session ü§ó",

He is a team player in every sense of the word. And, he is a joy to work with. Our small technology team here at Tribal was very sorry to see him go. Wherever he decides to invest his energies next, I know they will benefit immensely from his contribution (as we did at Tribal). I enthusiastically recommend Oscar."

First and foremost, Oscar is one of the most dedicated and tireless employees I ever hired in 10 years running Domani Studios, an award-winning digital advertising agency. He came aboard as a senior developer, and quickly proved his value working under hectic deadlines for a client who constantly moved the target. Within a year he was promoted to Director of Flash Development, leading our deep team of flash developers. And within a year of that promotion Oscar took the helm of the tech department entirely as Technology Director. It was a quick ascent, and well deserved. Oscar's range of technical knowledge is broad, and he has an uncanny ability to stay in the trenches of day-to-day development production methods while simultaneously absorbing the newest of technologies. His ability to walk a client through a technical hurdle or best-practice approach is outstanding, and his ability to rally a team of exhausted developers was a critical facet of our organization. I could easily outline dozens of instances Oscar either saved the day or preemptively steered the team clear of danger, but I think its best to simply say he is one of perhaps three employees I have hired that I would trust with absolutely anything, technical in nature or not. His integrity is bullet-proof, his work-ethic is flawless, and his loyalty is all that an owner could ever hope for. If you have the chance to work with Oscar, I'd jump on it.",

He allows the people in his team to openly express both their concerns and suggestions on the projects that we worked on, in turn producing great products. In addition, Oscar always makes the time to lend a hand or help troubleshoot an issue, even when he is swamped with his own tasks. Oscar's positive attitude and great sense of humor made my days at Domani Studios enjoyable.",

      "text": "Oscar Trelles is a very knowledgeable man. Through his dedication, patience and leadership, he increases the knowledge of those around him and serves as not only a colleague, but a teacher. Oscar was the Technology Director during my formative years as a Producer. There was a lot that I did not know (I'm still not all there), however whenever I had a question or was in a client-facing jam, Oscar was always available for a quick consult or technical intervention. Whether the problem was best solved by a rough sketch or via an illustrative metaphor, we always seemed to work through the issue at hand and define an appropriate solution to the problem. You haven't lived until you've somehow likened Ruby on Rails and Mongrels to dating and marriage. It goes without saying that Oscar is an incredibly talented 'tech guy.' He just flat-out knows seemingly everything about what it takes to develop best in class applications for the web. When you combine his depth of knowledge and ability to lead and manage with his positive attitude and friendly demeanor, you've got a TD who can handle any technical or non-technical issue that comes his way. When all else fails, just hand the guy a Grande bold. - he'll do whatever you ask...",

Oscar's leadership role kept the project on time even though we were dealing with multiple stakeholders within the university. Oscar never flinched at any of our ideas or concepts when we began discussing our needs, and better yet, he led his team to take those ideas and turn them into realities.

      "text": "I completed an absolutely transformative 10 weeks of systemic coaching with Oscar. In the time spent in the program, which coincided with the beginning of full-time entrepreneurship for me, I developed and grew my Intuition-Based Human Design business, signed five new clients in one week, launched a podcast on spirituality and created a community of readers for a creative newsletter. I was initially daunted by the prospect of creating a business - but working with Oscar has helped me to increase my confidence significantly. It was a wonderful balance of deep soul work and practical business advice and guidance clearly backed up with years of experience. I feel motivated and encouraged, considerably more resilient than I was before starting \"Unblocked in 10 Weeks\".",

      "text": "Taking the decision to walk-away from what is known, such as your career history to-date, and to embark on a new direction to be aligned with your purpose is one of the hardest decisions. Perhaps you made the decision to move away from what you had been doing, but the how, when, and what needs to be done to bring to life what is aligned with your purpose and build it is unclear. As someone that served in leadership at different tech companies, building something from the bottom is familiar, but that was based on previous experience, a support group (your team), and the resources that as a company you could leverage. Once you‚Äôve made the decision to be a solo-preneour this is no longer the case. You are now the CEO, the product, and everything else. Working with Oscar under his business program has taught and enabled me to look at the necessary stages for building something new from a macro level, zooming in as we moved forward. He has a research mindset that helped my projects come to life aided with insights, and a direction for a short and long term vision. What resonated the most was his continuous assessment of my energy levels at each stage to surface any personal potential blockers that could be impacting the progress. Having a coach that understands the importance of personal well-being was a must for me. He kept me motivated, accountable for the progress of my projects, and infused confidence for the direction I took on. Clarity for what‚Äôs next continued to build up from day one. It was all essential to bringing the new projects I now have ready to offer to the world. I would highly recommend it specially to anyone like me, who had a long career and now has found what fuels their passion and wants to embrace it full on leveraging what‚Äôs possible from their previous work life.",

      "text": "I was at a low point in my life when I came across Oscar‚Äôs program. I've been working for companies with a rather depressing corporate culture for years. Identifying myself as someone with a creative spirit, my job is very much at odds with my underlying values. I'm deeply troubled by it. Being laid off was a surprise, but at the same time I am determined not to rush to another soulless job that will never make me feel fulfilled. Doing what I love and working for myself has always been my dream but I'm not yet fully established in my next goal. Oscar is a very patient listener. He is able to hit the nail on the head with just a few words, the sharpest ones. Since we started the program, my friend and I partnered up and started organising our project, it's our passion and it iterated fast: setting up the workspace, deciding on the brand name, designing the logo and setting up our first event. There were a few blocks on the way, more precisely, it was the unresolved blockages from the past that were blocking my energy. Through let go meditation with Oscar, I was able to slowly heal myself and move forward with the project with more confidence. I would 100% recommend this program to anyone. There is a reason the program is set up for 10 sessions, it was only around the 7th session that I built up enough trust to speak up about the deep emotional blockages that were holding me back. After that there were still a lot of back and forth, but every time I think back to how I felt and how i was guided in that session, the energy came back and I was able to focus again. Above everything, I regained my trust in human-beings, which is priceless. Thank you Oscar!",
