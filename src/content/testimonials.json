      "text": "I had a beautiful experience attending a 9D breathwork session in M√°laga. The use of headphones created a deeply intimate and immersive environment even though we were within a group setting. The combination of guided breathwork, carefully curated music tracks, and a grounding meditation at the end made the session incredibly introspective and powerful. It allowed me to reconnect with myself and tap into something much greater. I‚Äôm truly grateful for the opportunity to participate, and I hope more people find their way to this work, especially parents in need of a reset, professionals managing high levels of stress, or anyone simply looking to reconnect and realign. Highly recommended. Thank you for holding such a transformative space.",

The physical and mental shift I experienced before and after the session was both significant and noticeable. Since attending the workshop, I‚Äôve become much more mindful of my breathing in everyday moments. I‚Äôve also found that practicing deep breathing at night has been especially helpful in winding down before bed. It was also lovely meeting new people as the group was small and intimate.

His deep knowledge and genuine passion for the practice created an environment that was both educational and empowering. Oscar's guidance through the breathing exercises and cold exposure techniques was clear and supportive, making the experience accessible even for beginners. His calm demeanor and encouragement helped me push past my perceived limits and discover a newfound resilience within myself. I left the session feeling invigorated, centered, and with tools I can incorporate into my daily routine. Highly recommend Oscar to anyone looking to explore the Wim Hof Method in a safe and inspiring setting.",

Finally we had the immersion experience in about 6 degrees water. Amazingly I did not feel too uncomfortable with the coldness but I felt a good sense of relaxation after the dip! I will certainly attend his next workshop as I sense the Method can relax and energize me. Muchas gracias Oscar!",

Oscar's empathy and coaching sessions cultivated a resilient attitude within me. I am thankful for this experience with Oscar; his ability to provide perspective is an invaluable tool for the challenge I am facing. Thanks to Oscar's wonderful support, I am fully aware that, in addition to medication, my recovery depends on my positive attitude and my mind sending the right messages to my body. I wholeheartedly recommend Oscar's work and am confident that many others will be helped as effectively by him as I have been.",

In the time spent in the program, which coincided with the beginning of full-time entrepreneurship for me, I developed and grew my Intuition-Based Human Design business, signed five new clients in one week, launched a podcast on spirituality and created a community of readers for a creative newsletter. I was initially daunted by the prospect of creating a business - but working with Oscar has helped me to increase my confidence significantly. It was a wonderful balance of deep soul work and practical business advice and guidance clearly backed up with years of experience. I feel motivated and encouraged, considerably more resilient than I was before starting \"Unblocked in 10 Weeks\"."

      "text": "Taking the decision to walk-away from what is known, such as your career history to-date, and to embark on a new direction to be aligned with your purpose is one of the hardest decisions. Perhaps you made the decision to move away from what you had been doing, but the how, when, and what needs to be done to bring to life what is aligned with your purpose and build it is unclear. As someone that served in leadership at different tech companies, building something from the bottom is familiar, but that was based on previous experience, a support group (your team), and the resources that as a company you could leverage. Once you‚Äôve made the decision to be a solo-preneour this is no longer the case. You are now the CEO, the product, and everything else. Working with Oscar under his business program has taught and enabled me to look at the necessary stages for building something new from a macro level, zooming in as we moved forward. He has a research mindset that helped my projects come to life aided with insights, and a direction for a short and long term vision. What resonated the most was his continuous assessment of my energy levels at each stage to surface any personal potential blockers that could be impacting the progress. Having a coach that understands the importance of personal well-being was a must for me. He kept me motivated, accountable for the progress of my projects, and infused confidence for the direction I took on. Clarity for what‚Äôs next continued to build up from day one. It was all essential to bringing the new projects I now have ready to offer to the world. I would highly recommend it specially to anyone like me, who had a long career and now has found what fuels their passion and wants to embrace it full on leveraging what‚Äôs possible from their previous work life.",

Identifying myself as someone with a creative spirit, my job is very much at odds with my underlying values. I'm deeply troubled by it. Being laid off was a surprise, but at the same time I am determined not to rush to another soulless job that will never make me feel fulfilled. Doing what I love and working for myself has always been my dream but I'm not yet fully established in my next goal. Oscar is a very patient listener. He is able to hit the nail on the head with just a few words, the sharpest ones. Since we started the program, my friend and I partnered up and started organising our project, it's our passion and it iterated fast: setting up the workspace, deciding on the brand name, designing the logo and setting up our first event. There were a few blocks on the way, more precisely, it was the unresolved blockages from the past that were blocking my energy. Through let go meditation with Oscar, I was able to slowly heal myself and move forward with the project with more confidence. I would 100% recommend this program to anyone. There is a reason the program is set up for 10 sessions, it was only around the 7th session that I built up enough trust to speak up about the deep emotional blockages that were holding me back. After that there were still a lot of back and forth, but every time I think back to how I felt and how i was guided in that session, the energy came back and I was able to focus again. Above everything, I regained my trust in human-beings, which is priceless. Thank you Oscar!",

      "text": "I was at a low point in my life when I came across Oscar‚Äôs program. I've been working for companies with a rather depressing corporate culture for years. Identifying myself as someone with a creative spirit, my job is very much at odds with my underlying values. I'm deeply troubled by it. Being laid off was a surprise, but at the same time I am determined not to rush to another soulless job that will never make me feel fulfilled. Doing what I love and working for myself has always been my dream but I'm not yet fully established in my next goal. Oscar is a very patient listener. He is able to hit the nail on the head with just a few words, the sharpest ones. Since we started the program, my friend and I partnered up and started organising our project, it's our passion and it iterated fast: setting up the workspace, deciding on the brand name, designing the logo and setting up our first event. There were a few blocks on the way, more precisely, it was the unresolved blockages from the past that were blocking my energy. Through let go meditation with Oscar, I was able to slowly heal myself and move forward with the project with more confidence. I would 100% recommend this program to anyone. There is a reason the program is set up for 10 sessions, it was only around the 7th session that I built up enough trust to speak up about the deep emotional blockages that were holding me back. After that there were still a lot of back and forth, but every time I think back to how I felt and how i was guided in that session, the energy came back and I was able to focus again. Above everything, I regained my trust in human-beings, which is priceless. Thank you Oscar!",
