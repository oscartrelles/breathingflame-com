        "text": "I had a beautiful experience attending a 9D breathwork session in Málaga. The use of headphones created a deeply intimate and immersive environment even though we were within a group setting. The combination of guided breathwork, carefully curated music tracks, and a grounding meditation at the end made the session incredibly introspective and powerful. It allowed me to reconnect with myself and tap into something much greater. I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to participate, and I hope more people find their way to this work, especially parents in need of a reset, professionals managing high levels of stress, or anyone simply looking to reconnect and realign. Highly recommended. Thank you for holding such a transformative space.",

His deep knowledge and genuine passion for the practice created an environment that was both educational and empowering. Oscar's guidance through the breathing exercises and cold exposure techniques was clear and supportive, making the experience accessible even for beginners.

I just want to thank Óscar, my colleagues, and Respira for bringing us such wonderful initiatives. If you're thinking about starting out with the method, I sincerely feel that Breathing Frame, led by Óscar, is the best option. Thank you! (Translated from Spanish)"

First and foremost, Oscar is one of the most dedicated and tireless employees I ever hired in 10 years running Domani Studios, an award-winning digital advertising agency. He came aboard as a senior developer, and quickly proved his value working under hectic deadlines for a client who constantly moved the target. Within a year he was promoted to Director of Flash Development, leading our deep team of flash developers. And within a year of that promotion Oscar took the helm of the tech department entirely as Technology Director. It was a quick ascent, and well deserved. Oscar's range of technical knowledge is broad, and he has an uncanny ability to stay in the trenches of day-to-day development production methods while simultaneously absorbing the newest of technologies. His ability to walk a client through a technical hurdle or best-practice approach is outstanding, and his ability to rally a team of exhausted developers was a critical facet of our organization. I could easily outline dozens of instances Oscar either saved the day or preemptively steered the team clear of danger, but I think its best to simply say he is one of perhaps three employees I have hired that I would trust with absolutely anything, technical in nature or not. His integrity is bullet-proof, his work-ethic is flawless, and his loyalty is all that an owner could ever hope for. If you have the chance to work with Oscar, I'd jump on it.",

It was way before that we first met in person that i heard about him as one of the most talented Latin Flash developers, kind of unreachable because he wasn't around Flash-related forums and was already living in the US. Though, from time to time he travelled to less-developed countries to share his knowledge with local developer communities, and that's how we first shared some emails. I found out that he is a genuine caring and thankful human being, worried about learning as much as he is about sharing what he learns, in order to get better (for himself and for the people surrounding him). So it's not only that he's doing some stunning work at one of the top digital shops in the world, but also the feeling that spending some time working with him will make you (much) better at work, and a better and (probably) more humble person.",

From the moment I met Oscar, my team was confident that Oscar not only understood our needs, but we knew he would deliver a great site. Oscar's leadership role kept the project on time even though we were dealing with multiple stakeholders within the university. Oscar never flinched at any of our ideas or concepts when we began discussing our needs, and better yet, he led his team to take those ideas and turn them into realities. It was a real privilege working with Oscar and I hope that we cross paths in the future."

There was a lot that I did not know (I'm still not all there), however whenever I had a question or was in a client-facing jam, Oscar was always available for a quick consult or technical intervention. Whether the problem was best solved by a rough sketch or via an illustrative metaphor, we always seemed to work through the issue at hand and define an appropriate solution to the problem. You haven't lived until you've somehow likened Ruby on Rails and Mongrels to dating and marriage. It goes without saying that Oscar is an incredibly talented 'tech guy.' He just flat-out knows seemingly everything about what it takes to develop best in class applications for the web. When you combine his depth of knowledge and ability to lead and manage with his positive attitude and friendly demeanor, you've got a TD who can handle any technical or non-technical issue that comes his way.

From his adept ability to build a development team (that was the most talented and laid-back i've encountered) to building a tech infrastructure and automated support system which streamlines daily workflow making everyones' job easier and more efficient (from developer to producer to designer to secretary)... All this and he's also a cool dude to have a beer with... Just can't be beat.",

In addition, Oscar always makes the time to lend a hand or help troubleshoot an issue, even when he is swamped with his own tasks.

        "text": "Taking the decision to walk-away from what is known, such as your career history to-date, and to embark on a new direction to be aligned with your purpose is one of the hardest decisions. Perhaps you made the decision to move away from what you had been doing, but the how, when, and what needs to be done to bring to life what is aligned with your purpose and build it is unclear. As someone that served in leadership at different tech companies, building something from the bottom is familiar, but that was based on previous experience, a support group (your team), and the resources that as a company you could leverage. Once you’ve made the decision to be a solo-preneour this is no longer the case. You are now the CEO, the product, and everything else. Working with Oscar under his business program has taught and enabled me to look at the necessary stages for building something new from a macro level, zooming in as we moved forward. He has a research mindset that helped my projects come to life aided with insights, and a direction for a short and long term vision. What resonated the most was his continuous assessment of my energy levels at each stage to surface any personal potential blockers that could be impacting the progress. Having a coach that understands the importance of personal well-being was a must for me. He kept me motivated, accountable for the progress of my projects, and infused confidence for the direction I took on. Clarity for what’s next continued to build up from day one. It was all essential to bringing the new projects I now have ready to offer to the world. I would highly recommend it specially to anyone like me, who had a long career and now has found what fuels their passion and wants to embrace it full on leveraging what’s possible from their previous work life.",

        "text": "I was at a low point in my life when I came across Oscar’s program. I've been working for companies with a rather depressing corporate culture for years. Identifying myself as someone with a creative spirit, my job is very much at odds with my underlying values. I'm deeply troubled by it. Being laid off was a surprise, but at the same time I am determined not to rush to another soulless job that will never make me feel fulfilled. Doing what I love and working for myself has always been my dream but I'm not yet fully established in my next goal. Oscar is a very patient listener. He is able to hit the nail on the head with just a few words, the sharpest ones. Since we started the program, my friend and I partnered up and started organising our project, it's our passion and it iterated fast: setting up the workspace, deciding on the brand name, designing the logo and setting up our first event. There were a few blocks on the way, more precisely, it was the unresolved blockages from the past that were blocking my energy. Through let go meditation with Oscar, I was able to slowly heal myself and move forward with the project with more confidence. I would 100% recommend this program to anyone. There is a reason the program is set up for 10 sessions, it was only around the 7th session that I built up enough trust to speak up about the deep emotional blockages that were holding me back. After that there were still a lot of back and forth, but every time I think back to how I felt and how i was guided in that session, the energy came back and I was able to focus again. Above everything, I regained my trust in human-beings, which is priceless. Thank you Oscar!",

The physical and mental shift I experienced before and after the session was both significant and noticeable. Since attending the workshop, I’ve become much more mindful of my breathing in everyday moments. I’ve also found that practicing deep breathing at night has been especially helpful in winding down before bed. It was also lovely meeting new people as the group was small and intimate.

      "content": "# The Science of Breathwork\n\nBreathwork isn't just a wellness trend—it's a scientifically-backed practice that can fundamentally change how your body and mind function. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the research behind conscious breathing and its profound effects on your health and performance.\n\n## The Physiology of Breathing\n\nWhen you breathe consciously, you're not just taking in oxygen. You're activating the autonomic nervous system, specifically the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest, recovery, and healing.\n\n### Key Physiological Changes\n\n- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: Conscious breathing increases HRV, a key marker of cardiovascular health and stress resilience\n- **Cortisol Reduction**: Studies show that breathwork can reduce cortisol levels by up to 40%\n- **Immune Function**: Deep breathing stimulates the lymphatic system and enhances immune response\n- **Neuroplasticity**: Regular practice can literally rewire your brain for better emotional regulation\n\n## The Wim Hof Method: A Case Study\n\nThe Wim Hof Method combines breathing techniques with cold exposure and meditation. Research has shown that practitioners can:\n\n- Control their immune response\n- Increase brown fat production\n- Improve focus and mental clarity\n- Reduce inflammation markers\n\n## Practical Applications\n\n### For Stress Management\n- 4-7-8 breathing technique\n- Box breathing for anxiety\n- Coherent breathing for emotional balance\n\n### For Performance\n- Power breathing before workouts\n- Recovery breathing between sets\n- Focus breathing for mental clarity\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin with just 5 minutes of conscious breathing daily. Focus on:\n\n1. **Diaphragmatic breathing**: Breathe into your belly, not your chest\n2. **Extended exhales**: Make your exhale longer than your inhale\n3. **Consistency**: Practice at the same time each day\n\nThe science is clear: breathwork is one of the most powerful tools we have for optimizing our physical and mental health. Start small, stay consistent, and watch as your life transforms one breath at a time."

      "content": "# Building Resilience Through Cold Therapy\n\nCold therapy, also known as cold exposure or cryotherapy, is one of the most powerful tools for building both mental and physical resilience. When practiced safely and consistently, it can transform your relationship with stress and discomfort.\n\n## The Science of Cold Adaptation\n\nCold exposure triggers a cascade of physiological responses designed to protect and strengthen your body:\n\n### Immediate Effects\n- **Vasoconstriction**: Blood vessels constrict to preserve core temperature\n- **Increased Heart Rate**: Your heart works harder to maintain circulation\n- **Release of Stress Hormones**: Adrenaline and noradrenaline surge through your system\n\n### Long-term Adaptations\n- **Brown Fat Activation**: Cold exposure increases brown adipose tissue, which burns calories to generate heat\n- **Improved Circulation**: Regular cold exposure strengthens your cardiovascular system\n- **Enhanced Immune Function**: Cold therapy can boost your immune response and reduce inflammation\n\n## Mental Resilience Benefits\n\nThe mental benefits of cold therapy are perhaps even more profound than the physical ones:\n\n- **Stress Inoculation**: Regular exposure to controlled stress builds your capacity to handle life's challenges\n- **Mental Toughness**: Learning to stay calm in uncomfortable situations transfers to all areas of life\n- **Emotional Regulation**: Cold therapy can help you develop better control over your emotional responses\n\n## Getting Started Safely\n\n### Beginner Protocol\n1. **Start with cold showers**: Begin with 30 seconds of cold water at the end of your regular shower\n2. **Gradually increase duration**: Add 10-15 seconds each week\n3. **Focus on your breathing**: Use breathwork techniques to stay calm and centered\n4. **Listen to your body**: Never push beyond your comfort zone too quickly\n\n### Intermediate Practices\n- **Ice baths**: 2-5 minutes in water between 50-60°F\n- **Cold plunges**: Natural bodies of water when available\n- **Cryotherapy chambers**: Professional cold therapy sessions\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare provider before starting cold therapy, especially if you have:\n- Cardiovascular conditions\n- High blood pressure\n- Raynaud's disease\n- Pregnancy\n\n## The Wim Hof Method Integration\n\nCombining cold therapy with the Wim Hof breathing method can amplify the benefits:\n\n1. **Preparation breathing**: 3-4 rounds of power breathing\n2. **Cold exposure**: Start with 1-2 minutes\n3. **Recovery breathing**: Focus on slow, deep breaths\n4. **Reflection**: Notice how you feel physically and mentally\n\n## Building Your Practice\n\n### Week 1-2: Foundation\n- Cold showers: 30-60 seconds\n- Focus on breathing and staying calm\n- Document your experience\n\n### Week 3-4: Progression\n- Cold showers: 1-2 minutes\n- Add ice to your bath water\n- Practice in different environments\n\n### Month 2+: Mastery\n- Ice baths: 2-5 minutes\n- Cold water swimming\n- Advanced breathing techniques\n\n## The Transformation\n\nAfter 30 days of consistent practice, you'll notice:\n\n- **Improved sleep quality**\n- **Enhanced mood and energy**\n- **Better stress management**\n- **Increased confidence**\n- **Stronger immune system**\n\nCold therapy isn't about being tough—it's about learning to be comfortable with discomfort. This skill transfers to every area of your life, making you more resilient, confident, and capable of handling whatever challenges come your way.\n\nStart small, stay consistent, and watch as your relationship with stress transforms."

      "content": "# Mindfulness for Busy Professionals\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, finding time for mindfulness can feel like just another item on an endless to-do list. But what if I told you that effective mindfulness doesn't require hours of meditation or a complete lifestyle overhaul?\n\n## The 5-Minute Rule\n\nThe key to sustainable mindfulness for busy professionals is the 5-minute rule: start with just 5 minutes daily. This approach is:\n\n- **Achievable**: Anyone can find 5 minutes\n- **Sustainable**: Builds a habit without overwhelming your schedule\n- **Effective**: Even short practices create measurable benefits\n\n## Micro-Mindfulness Techniques\n\n### 1. The Breathing Space (2-3 minutes)\nPerfect for between meetings or during transitions:\n\n1. **Stop**: Pause whatever you're doing\n2. **Breathe**: Take 3 deep, conscious breaths\n3. **Notice**: Observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations\n4. **Choose**: Decide how you want to respond to the next moment\n\n### 2. The Mindful Minute (1 minute)\nUse this during any brief pause:\n\n- Set a timer for 60 seconds\n- Focus entirely on your breath\n- When your mind wanders, gently return to breathing\n- Notice the quality of your attention\n\n### 3. Walking Meditation (5 minutes)\nTransform your daily walks into mindfulness practice:\n\n- Walk at a natural pace\n- Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground\n- Notice the rhythm of your steps\n- Observe your surroundings without judgment\n\n## Desk-Based Practices\n\n### The 4-7-8 Breathing Technique\nIdeal for stress management at your desk:\n\n1. Inhale for 4 counts\n2. Hold for 7 counts\n3. Exhale for 8 counts\n4. Repeat 4 times\n\n### The Body Scan (3-5 minutes)\nA quick check-in with your body:\n\n1. Start at the top of your head\n2. Slowly scan down through your body\n3. Notice any tension or discomfort\n4. Breathe into areas of tension\n5. End at your feet\n\n## Technology-Assisted Mindfulness\n\n### Apps for Busy Professionals\n- **Headspace**: Short, guided meditations\n- **Calm**: Quick stress-relief sessions\n- **Insight Timer**: Free, customizable timers\n- **Ten Percent Happier**: Practical, science-based approach\n\n### Smartphone Reminders\n- Set hourly breathing reminders\n- Use calendar alerts for mindfulness breaks\n- Create a \"mindfulness\" folder with quick practices\n\n## The Science Behind Micro-Practices\n\nResearch shows that even brief mindfulness practices can:\n\n- **Reduce cortisol levels** by up to 25%\n- **Improve focus and attention** within 2 weeks\n- **Enhance emotional regulation** in high-stress situations\n- **Boost immune function** with regular practice\n\n## Creating Your Practice\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Choose one technique\n- Practice for 5 minutes daily\n- Set a specific time and place\n- Track your consistency\n\n### Week 2: Expansion\n- Add a second technique\n- Practice at different times of day\n- Notice patterns in your stress levels\n- Adjust your approach as needed\n\n### Week 3: Integration\n- Combine techniques\n- Practice during transitions\n- Use mindfulness in challenging situations\n- Share your experience with others\n\n### Week 4: Mastery\n- Develop your own micro-practices\n- Teach others what you've learned\n- Create a sustainable routine\n- Celebrate your progress\n\n## Common Challenges and Solutions\n\n### \"I don't have time\"\n**Solution**: Start with 1-minute practices. You have time for one minute.\n\n### \"My mind won't stop racing\"\n**Solution**: That's normal. The goal isn't to stop thoughts—it's to notice them without judgment.\n\n### \"I keep forgetting to practice\"\n**Solution**: Set specific triggers (after coffee, before lunch, etc.) and use reminders.\n\n### \"I don't feel any different\"\n**Solution**: Give it 2 weeks. The benefits are cumulative and often subtle at first.\n\n## The Ripple Effect\n\nAs you develop your mindfulness practice, you'll notice changes in:\n\n- **Decision-making**: More thoughtful, less reactive\n- **Relationships**: Better listening, more empathy\n- **Performance**: Improved focus, reduced errors\n- **Wellbeing**: Less stress, more satisfaction\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\n1. **Choose one technique** from this article\n2. **Set a 5-minute timer** for tomorrow\n3. **Practice consistently** for one week\n4. **Notice the changes** in your daily experience\n5. **Share your success** with your team or colleagues\n\nRemember: mindfulness isn't about perfection—it's about presence. Even 5 minutes of imperfect practice is better than no practice at all.\n\nStart today. Your future self will thank you.",

I had met Oscar a few days prior and just by the short conversation we had and the energy that he transmits i knew I had met someone special. Besides that, the location is perfect, comfortable and with very cool hand painted interior…goes well with the theme of the event. Thanks again Oscar",

The use of headphones created a deeply intimate and immersive environment even though we were within a group setting. The combination of guided breathwork, carefully curated music tracks, and a grounding meditation at the end made the session incredibly introspective and powerful. It allowed me to reconnect with myself and tap into something much greater. I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to participate, and I hope more people find their way to this work, especially parents in need of a reset, professionals managing high levels of stress, or anyone simply looking to reconnect and realign. Highly recommended. Thank you for holding such a transformative space.",

His calm demeanor and encouragement helped me push past my perceived limits and discover a newfound resilience within myself.

      "text": "There is a lot to say about Oscar, and its all good. First and foremost, Oscar is one of the most dedicated and tireless employees I ever hired in 10 years running Domani Studios, an award-winning digital advertising agency. He came aboard as a senior developer, and quickly proved his value working under hectic deadlines for a client who constantly moved the target. Within a year he was promoted to Director of Flash Development, leading our deep team of flash developers. And within a year of that promotion Oscar took the helm of the tech department entirely as Technology Director. It was a quick ascent, and well deserved. Oscar's range of technical knowledge is broad, and he has an uncanny ability to stay in the trenches of day-to-day development production methods while simultaneously absorbing the newest of technologies. His ability to walk a client through a technical hurdle or best-practice approach is outstanding, and his ability to rally a team of exhausted developers was a critical facet of our organization. I could easily outline dozens of instances Oscar either saved the day or preemptively steered the team clear of danger, but I think its best to simply say he is one of perhaps three employees I have hired that I would trust with absolutely anything, technical in nature or not. His integrity is bullet-proof, his work-ethic is flawless, and his loyalty is all that an owner could ever hope for. If you have the chance to work with Oscar, I'd jump on it.",

I found out that he is a genuine caring and thankful human being, worried about learning as much as he is about sharing what he learns, in order to get better (for himself and for the people surrounding him).

Through his dedication, patience and leadership, he increases the knowledge of those around him and serves as not only a colleague, but a teacher. Oscar was the Technology Director during my formative years as a Producer. There was a lot that I did not know (I'm still not all there), however whenever I had a question or was in a client-facing jam, Oscar was always available for a quick consult or technical intervention. Whether the problem was best solved by a rough sketch or via an illustrative metaphor, we always seemed to work through the issue at hand and define an appropriate solution to the problem. You haven't lived until you've somehow likened Ruby on Rails and Mongrels to dating and marriage. It goes without saying that Oscar is an incredibly talented 'tech guy.' He just flat-out knows seemingly everything about what it takes to develop best in class applications for the web. When you combine his depth of knowledge and ability to lead and manage with his positive attitude and friendly demeanor, you've got a TD who can handle any technical or non-technical issue that comes his way. When all else fails, just hand the guy a Grande bold. - he'll do whatever you ask...",

From his adept ability to build a development team (that was the most talented and laid-back i've encountered) to building a tech infrastructure and automated support system which streamlines daily workflow making everyones' job easier and more efficient (from developer to producer to designer to secretary)... All this and he's also a cool dude to have a beer with... Just can't be beat.",

What I liked most about working with Oscar is that he always had the answer to the most difficult questions -- and when he didn't, he was completely without ego in terms of asking for help from his team or externally. Clients came to trust Oscar as a tech lead who helped them any number of issues that global marketers normally face -- such as hosting, site speed, version control -- just to name a few. He's patient with those who don't speak technology at his level -- both internally and client-side. A great technologist - I strongly recommend Oscar.",

      "text": "Taking the decision to walk-away from what is known, such as your career history to-date, and to embark on a new direction to be aligned with your purpose is one of the hardest decisions. Perhaps you made the decision to move away from what you had been doing, but the how, when, and what needs to be done to bring to life what is aligned with your purpose and build it is unclear. As someone that served in leadership at different tech companies, building something from the bottom is familiar, but that was based on previous experience, a support group (your team), and the resources that as a company you could leverage. Once you’ve made the decision to be a solo-preneour this is no longer the case. You are now the CEO, the product, and everything else. Working with Oscar under his business program has taught and enabled me to look at the necessary stages for building something new from a macro level, zooming in as we moved forward. He has a research mindset that helped my projects come to life aided with insights, and a direction for a short and long term vision. What resonated the most was his continuous assessment of my energy levels at each stage to surface any personal potential blockers that could be impacting the progress. Having a coach that understands the importance of personal well-being was a must for me. He kept me motivated, accountable for the progress of my projects, and infused confidence for the direction I took on. Clarity for what’s next continued to build up from day one. It was all essential to bringing the new projects I now have ready to offer to the world. I would highly recommend it specially to anyone like me, who had a long career and now has found what fuels their passion and wants to embrace it full on leveraging what’s possible from their previous work life.",

Identifying myself as someone with a creative spirit, my job is very much at odds with my underlying values. I'm deeply troubled by it. Being laid off was a surprise, but at the same time I am determined not to rush to another soulless job that will never make me feel fulfilled. Doing what I love and working for myself has always been my dream but I'm not yet fully established in my next goal. Oscar is a very patient listener. He is able to hit the nail on the head with just a few words, the sharpest ones. Since we started the program, my friend and I partnered up and started organising our project, it's our passion and it iterated fast: setting up the workspace, deciding on the brand name, designing the logo and setting up our first event. There were a few blocks on the way, more precisely, it was the unresolved blockages from the past that were blocking my energy. Through let go meditation with Oscar, I was able to slowly heal myself and move forward with the project with more confidence. I would 100% recommend this program to anyone. There is a reason the program is set up for 10 sessions, it was only around the 7th session that I built up enough trust to speak up about the deep emotional blockages that were holding me back. After that there were still a lot of back and forth, but every time I think back to how I felt and how i was guided in that session, the energy came back and I was able to focus again. Above everything, I regained my trust in human-beings, which is priceless. Thank you Oscar!",

Oscar's empathy and coaching sessions cultivated a resilient attitude within me. I am thankful for this experience with Oscar; his ability to provide perspective is an invaluable tool for the challenge I am facing. Thanks to Oscar's wonderful support, I am fully aware that, in addition to medication, my recovery depends on my positive attitude and my mind sending the right messages to my body. I wholeheartedly recommend Oscar's work and am confident that many others will be helped as effectively by him as I have been.",

What truly amazed me was how impactful a 20-minute breathwork exercise could be. With Oscar’s supportive guidance, I was able to achieve a profound sense of relaxation and calm. The physical and mental shift I experienced before and after the session was both significant and noticeable. Since attending the workshop, I’ve become much more mindful of my breathing in everyday moments. I’ve also found that practicing deep breathing at night has been especially helpful in winding down before bed. It was also lovely meeting new people as the group was small and intimate. Thank you Oscar for a wonderful and uplifting session 🤗",

In the time spent in the program, which coincided with the beginning of full-time entrepreneurship for me, I developed and grew my Intuition-Based Human Design business, signed five new clients in one week, launched a podcast on spirituality and created a community of readers for a creative newsletter. I was initially daunted by the prospect of creating a business - but working with Oscar has helped me to increase my confidence significantly. It was a wonderful balance of deep soul work and practical business advice and guidance clearly backed up with years of experience. I feel motivated and encouraged, considerably more resilient than I was before starting \"Unblocked in 10 Weeks\".",
